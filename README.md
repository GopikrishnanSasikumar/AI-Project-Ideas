## 1. Receptionist Chatbot for educational institutes

### tags: NLP, deep learning, chatbots.

A college receptionist is an organized individual who deals with the public over the phone, through emails and in person. She is often the first point of contact with prospective students and their parents. What if you can automate this using a chatbot or a voice assistant ?

School/ College autorities should be able to easily store various informations about their institution to our service using a dashboard. AI chatbot will learn this details using machine learning alogrithms. When a student or parent ask a question, the bot will answer based on what it learned.

## 2. OCR for native languages.

### tags: computer vision, Convnets, Deep learning.

Character recognition from images for native languages like malayalam, tamil, kannada..etc.

## 3. Implementation of Mozilla common voice API in Javascript

### tags: Voice recognition, deep learning.

There is no good open source api for voice recognition right now. Mozilla open sourced [deep speech project](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech) for voice recognition using python. Google released its javascript version of Tensorflow this year. Implement the common voice api in [tensorflowjs](https://js.tensorflow.org) and build a voice recognition model for the web.

## 4. Emergency Response system for women safety

### tags : Reinforcement Learning, deep learning.

Alert system for efficient communication with authorities the alarm triggered by a women when she is about to be attacked. For example, finding the nearest safe zones, police stations, nearest friends and relatives..etc.

## 5. Fake news detection using ML

### tags: NLP, deep learning, machine learning.

A cliche project in machine learning but its good to build better model that's actually working and improve existing models.

## 6. AI app for collecting datasets

### tags: data science, machine learning, deep learning.

ML/DL need a lot of datasets for training the models. What about building an Android/IOS app that makes data collection easy ? Use pretrained models like Imagenet and various NLP models to do automatic labelling, various statictical techniques to automatically generate summary of datasets. Use various preprocessing techniques to apply a particular preprocessing technique to a dataset. What i am saying is an excel for data science!
